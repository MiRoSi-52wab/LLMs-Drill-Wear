# Festo Plant for Discrete Manufacturing Developing Simulation Models for Industrial Copilots

**Technical University of Munich (TUM)**
**Siemens Technology AG**
**Course:** Software Lab 2025 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an implementation of both **Single Agent** and **Multi-Agent** systems that through the usage of developed tools aim to predict the wear and quality of the drilling process in a Festo Plant. With this project, new users can query the agentic system about different drilling processes and receive natural language responses from the Large Language Models. 

The goal of the project is to create an interface that allows users (with little experience about Festo Plant Drilling Processes) to get responses about different characteristics of the process, by only the usage of natural language. 

The dataset used was from: *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raphaelwallsberger/xai-drilling-dataset*

## ✨ Key Features & Tasks

This software implements the agentic systems and tool extensions derived from the project requirements:

### 🔹 Agentic Systems
* **Single Agent System**: Created only 1 Agent to logically respond to user's queries by handlinh simulateneously all tasks.
* **Multi Agent (Supervisor System)**: Implemented 3 Agents: **Quality Agent**, **Wear Agent**, **Supervisor**. These 3 agents work together to respond to queries by specializing in only 1 part of the tasks needed. 


### 🚀 Tools Created

#### Tool 1: Wear and Degradation Tool
* **Inputs**: Material to be used for drilling, feed rate when drilling [mm/min] and cutting speed [m/min].
* **Outputs**: The tool uses XGBoost to classify different probabilities of failure. By dividing the wear into 3 categories: 0 (no wear), 1 (degradation) and 2 (failure of flank), the tool outputs the probability of the system falling into each category. More information inside the Degradation Tool folder. 

#### Tool 2: Quality of Drilling Tool
* **Inputs**: Cooling rate [%] used in drilling process, feed rate, cutting speed and drill bit material.
* **Outputs**: The tool also uses a decision tree algorithm with boosting to create different criteria for decision. With these creiteria, the tool is able to correctly predict if there will be Good or Bad quaity of drilling following the BEF and CCF data. More information inside Quality Tool folder.
